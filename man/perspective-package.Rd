\title{peRspective: Interface to the Perspective API}
\description{
Provides access to the Perspective API (\url{http://www.perspectiveapi.com/}). Perspective is an API that uses machine learning models to score the perceived impact a comment might have on a conversation.
\code{peRspective} provides access to the API using the R programming language.
For an excellent documentation of the Perspective API see \href{https://github.com/conversationai/perspectiveapi/blob/master/api_reference.md}{here}.
}
\section{Get API Key}{

\enumerate{
\item Create a Google Cloud project in your \href{https://console.developers.google.com/}{Google Cloud console}
\item Go to \href{https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/overview}{Perspective API's overview page} and click \strong{\emph{Enable}}
\item Go to the \href{https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials}{API credentials page}, just click \strong{\emph{Create credentials}}, and choose "API Key".
}
}

\section{Suggested Usage of API Key}{

\pkg{peRspective} functions will read the API key from
environment variable \code{perspective_api_key}.
You can specify it like this at the start of your script:

\code{Sys.setenv(perspective_api_key = "**********")}

To start R session with the
initialized environment variable create an \code{.Renviron} file in your R home
with a line like this:

\code{perspective_api_key = "**********"}

To check where your R home is, try \code{normalizePath("~")}.
}

\section{Quota and character length Limits}{

You can check your quota limits by going to \href{https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/quotas}{your google cloud project's Perspective API page}, and check
your projects quota usage at
\href{https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas}{the cloud console quota usage page}.

The maximum text size per request is 3000 bytes.

\section{Alpha models}{


The following alpha models are \strong{recommended} for use. They have been tested
across multiple domains and trained on hundreds of thousands of comments tagged
by thousands of human moderators. These are available in \strong{English (en) and Spanish (es)}.
\itemize{
\item \strong{TOXICITY}: rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to
make people leave a discussion. This model is a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network}{Convolutional Neural Network} (CNN)
trained with \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec}{word-vector}
inputs.
\item \strong{SEVERE_TOXICITY}: This model uses the same deep-CNN algorithm as the
TOXICITY model, but is trained to recognize examples that were considered
to be 'very toxic' by crowdworkers. This makes it much less sensitive to
comments that include positive uses of curse-words for example. A labelled dataset
and details of the methodology can be found in the same \href{https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Talk_Labels_Toxicity/4563973}{toxicity dataset} that is
available for the toxicity model.
}
}

\section{Experimental models}{


The following experimental models give more fine-grained classifications than
overall toxicity. They were trained on a relatively smaller amount of data
compared to the primary toxicity models above and have not been tested as
thoroughly.
\itemize{
\item \strong{IDENTITY_ATTACK}: negative or hateful comments targeting someone because of their identity.
\item \strong{INSULT}: insulting, inflammatory, or negative comment towards a person
or a group of people.
\item \strong{PROFANITY}: swear words, curse words, or other obscene or profane
language.
\item \strong{THREAT}: describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence
against an individual or group.
\item \strong{SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT}: contains references to sexual acts, body parts, or
other lewd content.
\item \strong{FLIRTATION}: pickup lines, complimenting appearance, subtle sexual
innuendos, etc.
}

For more details on how these were trained, see the \href{https://github.com/conversationai/conversationai.github.io/blob/master/crowdsourcing_annotation_schemes/toxicity_with_subattributes.md}{Toxicity and sub-attribute annotation guidelines}.
}

\section{New York Times moderation models}{


The following experimental models were trained on New York Times data tagged by
their moderation team.
\itemize{
\item \strong{ATTACK_ON_AUTHOR}: Attack on the author of an article or post.
\item \strong{ATTACK_ON_COMMENTER}: Attack on fellow commenter.
\item \strong{INCOHERENT}: Difficult to understand, nonsensical.
\item \strong{INFLAMMATORY}: Intending to provoke or inflame.
\item \strong{LIKELY_TO_REJECT}: Overall measure of the likelihood for the comment to
be rejected according to the NYT's moderation.
\item \strong{OBSCENE}: Obscene or vulgar language such as cursing.
\item \strong{SPAM}: Irrelevant and unsolicited commercial content.
\item \strong{UNSUBSTANTIAL}: Trivial or short comments.
}
